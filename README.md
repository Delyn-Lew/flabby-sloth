## Introduction
This game is inspired by the famous casual mobile game, Flappy Bird. <br>
Flappy bird has been around for 11 years now, and at some point of our lives we might have been addicted to playing it. <br>
With flappy bear, instead of flying we will now have a bear jumping through trees to gain score. <br>
The player will control the bear with the spacebar and maneuvere through the trees that has random heights. <br>
Gravity acts on the bear, it automatically falls once game has started and would only jump when the spacebar is release! <br>
The game will continue through until a collision of tree or ground is detected. <br>
